[Xqerl](https://github.com/zadean/xqerl) pronounced 'squirrel',  is a XQuery 3.1 application server and database.
 The xqerl database provides a conveniant store for hierarchical collections of [XDM](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel-31/) items. 
[XQuery 3.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/) is the query language used for building data driven web applications 
from the data stored in the xqerl database.

Xqerl is an erlang application that runs on top of the Erlang virtual machine [BEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine))
[Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) applications have a reputation for being long running, fault tolerant and reliable.
This project uses a xqerl container image, so you do not need to locally install erlang or even know much about erlang.

# glider: A template repo

This template provides ...
A XQuery web application development environment will enable you to locally 
produce, check and remotely deploy muiltiple secure sites for the domains you own.

This template contains ...
some boilerplate files in the src directory 
which are used to create an example website.

```
make up
make
w3m -dump http://example.com
```


TODO
## WIP note

Code is a work in progress.
Some stuff is pulled from other projects, and needs to be rewritten for this project.
I try to take 'show not tell' approach,
so working code will be run on 'github actions'
and will be making some asciicast.
