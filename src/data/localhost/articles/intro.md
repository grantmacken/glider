## Introduction

The [squirrel glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_glider) not to be confused with the flying squirrel, is a nocturnal gliding possum that
lives amongst the trees of Australia.

Xqerl pronounced squirrel, is a XQuery application server that has two main components 
  - a [XQuery 3.1 ](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/) application engine.
  - a database that stores [XDM data](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/) items identified by URI. 

The xqerl glider project aims to help you set up a web application development environment,
suitable for building containerised secure XQuery web applications based on the xqerl application server

If you are new to XQuery please refer to the resources at [learn XQuery ](https://github.com/joewiz/learn-xquery)
