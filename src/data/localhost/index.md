lives amongst the trees of Australia.

Xqerl pronounced squirrel, is a XQuery application server that has two main components 
  - a [XQuery 3.1 ](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-31/) application engine.
  - a database that stores [XDM data](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/) items identified by URI.
